# Madanw Portfolio Website

A modern, responsive portfolio website built with React, JavaScript, and CSS. This project serves as my personal platform for showcasing my projects and experiences as a sophomore at the University of Minnesota. The design features a sleek gradient background (starting at `#0c340c` and transitioning to white) paired with a clean, minimalist layout.
